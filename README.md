# BatSang

BatSang was our entry for the **College Game Awards**, developed by a team of three. Each member contributed uniquely to the project:

- **UI Design:** One team member focused on crafting an intuitive and polished user interface.
- **Sound & Visual Effects:** Another handled the sound design and VFX to enhance the overall atmosphere.
- **Game Mechanics:** I worked on implementing core game mechanics, utilizing techniques such as **splines, ragdolls, constraints, and inverse kinematics** to bring the gameplay to life.

## Experience & Learning

Although we didn't win the award, the journey of creating BatSang was an invaluable experience. We pushed our creative and technical limits, refining our skills and gaining extensive knowledge in game development. The project was a testament to teamwork, innovation, and perseverance.
