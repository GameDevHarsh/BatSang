# BatSang

BatSang was our entry for the **College Game Awards**, developed by a team of three. Each member contributed uniquely to the project:

- **UI Design:** One team member focused on crafting an intuitive and polished user interface.
- **Sound & Visual Effects:** Another handled the sound design and VFX to enhance the overall atmosphere.
- **Game Mechanics:** I worked on implementing core game mechanics, utilizing techniques such as **splines, ragdolls, constraints, and inverse kinematics** to bring the gameplay to life.
